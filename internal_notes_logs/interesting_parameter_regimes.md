For the above parameters, you find one of these neat, barely-unstable, resistive KH modes. I see no indications of 
noteworthy non-modal growth in the epsilon-pseudospectra though.

Here there's some significant non-modal growth. The pseudospectrum for epsilon=0.1 reaches beyond the 
most unstable mode by almost 0.2.

Here if you zoom out on the horizontal (real frequency) axis you see there's actually multiple branches that are very 
close to being unstable, and they each yield unstable pseudospectra at epsilon = 0.1. Also, there's MORE non-modal 
growth here than at Re = Rm = 500, counter to what happens in stratified case!
