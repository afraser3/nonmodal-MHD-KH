> Reynolds = 50.0  
mReynolds = 0.5  
kx = 0.005  
MA = 0.75

For the above parameters, you find one of these neat, barely-unstable, resistive KH modes. I see no indications of 
noteworthy non-modal growth in the epsilon-pseudospectra though.

> Reynolds = 50.0  
> mReynolds = 50.0  
> kx = 0.1  
> MA = 1.1

Here there's some possibly-significant non-modal growth, I think. The pseudospectrum for epsilon=0.1 reaches beyond the 
most unstable mode by almost 0.2.
