# Tables of various run parameters
Listing here the various parameters relevant to the .cfg files found in python/config_files/

Following Jeff's suggestion of letting lettered runs (run_A.cfg, run_B.cfg, etc) denote startup/exploratory runs, 
while numbered runs will denote science/publication runs. 

In the second column, "start", "stop", and "num" are describing the scan in MA that I did: 
it starts at "start", ends at "stop", and there were "num" points in the scan. 

## Lettered runs
