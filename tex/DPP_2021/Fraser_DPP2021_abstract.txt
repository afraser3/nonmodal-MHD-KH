Title: Nonmodal growth and epsilon-pseudospectra of MHD shear flows with stabilizing magnetic fields

Shear flows are commonplace in astrophysical plasmas.
In some parameter regimes, they serve as a free energy source to drive fluctuations and turbulence that can enhance momentum, energy, and particle transport, thus crucially affecting the evolution of the system.
The boundary between parameter regimes where fluctuations are or are not driven by flow shear is often assumed to be provided by linear stability analyses.
However, in many other systems, including pipe flow and stratified shear flows in neutral fluids, linear stability analyses are known to be misleading: even when systems are linearly stable, perturbations can grow significantly through so-called nonmodal or non-normal growth, giving rise to turbulence and mixing where linear stability analyses predicts no growth.
Here we explore the degree of nonmodal growth when equilibrium magnetic fields aligned with the flow nearly or entirely stabilize shear-flow instabilities.
Even in 2D, pseudospectra indicate significant nonmodal amplification in linearly stable regimes.
We also present progress towards comparisons of 2D and 3D optimal linear perturbations that maximize fluctuation growth.
